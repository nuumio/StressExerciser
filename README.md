# Stress Exerciser

Stress Exerciser is a tool for creating load on your computer system. Select a workload type
from combobox, add it (or multiple copies of it) to workload list and start the exercise.
You may optionally set automatic exercise stop (default on, 60 seconds).

NOTE: Putting too much load on system may cause it to freeze and it may be very difficult to
stop the exercise. Also, automatic stopping may be triggered (very) late in such conditions.

My second Windows app (and my first C++ app) since 90's so please excuse the code quality :D
